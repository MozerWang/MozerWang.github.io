<!-- ## About Me -->

I am **Minzheng Wang**, a second-year Ph.D student at the [MAIS, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ia.cas.cn/), supervised by [Nan Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oJcp__wAAAAJ) and [Wenji Mao](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~maowenji). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/) in 2023. I have also spent time at the [Tongyi Lab, Alibaba Group](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xF5VrokAAAAJ&hl=en) as a Research Intern, mentored by [Xinghua Zhang](https://xinghuazhang.top/).


# Research 🔍
I am broadly interested in natural language processing and large language models. My current research focuses on **1) LLM-based Social Agent, 2) LLM Role-play, and 3) LLM-based RL.**
